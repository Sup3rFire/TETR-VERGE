A powerful analytics engine for TETR.IO

## What's Verge?
Verge allows you to scope out opponents and understand their playstyle, strengths and weaknesses. VERGE automatically generates a player's traits by analyzing their  statistics and previous matchups. A key difference between VERGE and other TETR.IO tools is that VERGE displays these stats in-game. Instead of needing to tab to a different window and type a player's name to see their playstyle, VERGE allows you to view critical information with a single click.
